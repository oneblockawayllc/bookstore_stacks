# STACKS Landing Page Content Rework

**Date**: 2025-12-16
**Status**: Approved

---

## The Problem

The current page has no soul. It reads like generic SaaS marketing copy - "Turn Browsers Into Buyers," "Discovery Friction," "AI-Powered." Technically correct but emotionally flat.

---

## Emotional Arc

The page should flow through these feelings:

1. **Recognition** (Hero) - "These people get us"
2. **Relief** (Problem) - "They understand the struggle"
3. **Excitement** (Solution) - "This could change things"
4. **Trust** (CTA) - "I want to learn more"

---

## Voice

**Indie tech friend** - Not corporate, not salesy. Like a friend who built something cool and wants to show you. Conversational, enthusiastic, real.

---

## Section-by-Section Content

### Hero

**Badge:** "For Indie Bookstores"

**Headline:** "Books Aren't Searched. They're Discovered."

**Subhead:** "Your customers don't type 'ISBN 978-0-14-028329-7.' They type 'cozy mystery set in a bookshop' or 'like Succession but a book.' Now your website understands that."

**Mockup:** Real query examples that feel human - the weird, wonderful ways readers describe what they want.

---

### Problem

**Headline:** "Your Best Bookseller Can't Be Everywhere"

**Copy:**
"They're the one who hears 'I don't know what I want, but I'll know it when I see it' and somehow pulls the perfect book off the shelf. They remember who loved *The Secret History* and which customer is going through a divorce. They *get* people.

But they can't work every shift. They can't be on your website at 11pm. And they definitely can't help three customers at once while answering the phone."

**The question:** "What if your website had that instinct?"

---

### Solution

**Headline:** "Meet STACKS"

**Copy:**
"We built a search that speaks reader, not keyword.

Type 'dark academia with a secret society' - it gets it.
Type 'like The Bear but make it a bakery' - it gets it.
Type 'something to read after a breakup that won't make me cry' - yeah, it gets that too.

It searches *your* catalog. Your shelves. Your inventory. Not Amazon's infinite scroll of everything. Just the books you actually carry, matched to what your customer actually wants."

**No feature tags.** The copy itself carries the message.

---

### Positions

**Headline:** "Add It Wherever Makes Sense"

**Position 1: The Search Bar**
"Replace your current search with one that actually understands humans."

*Mockup: Fake bookstore page with header, hero area featuring the STACKS search bar, and book grid below. Query shown: "enemies to lovers on a spaceship"*

**Position 2: The Little Helper**
"A floating button that's always there when someone gets stuck browsing. Tap it, type a vibe, find a book."

*Mockup: Full fake page layout - header with logo, hero section with headline + fake text lines, book grid/content blocks, FAB button overlaying in corner*

**Position 3: The Discovery Page**
"Give it a whole page. Let customers explore moods and vibes. Perfect for that 'I don't know what I want' energy."

*Mockup: Fake bookstore header, full discovery UI with search bar, vibe chips, results grid*

**No bullet points.** One sentence each. Visuals do the heavy lifting. Mockups should feel like screenshots of real bookstore sites with STACKS embedded.

---

### CTA

**Headline:** "Curious?"

**Copy:** "We're a small team that loves bookstores. See how it works, peek under the hood, ask us anything."

**Button:** "Learn More"

---

## Key Differentiators (woven throughout)

1. **Speaks reader language** - Vibes, moods, references. Not keywords.
2. **Their catalog, not Amazon's** - Local inventory, your shelves.
3. **Bookseller intuition at scale** - What great employees do, automated.

---

## Implementation Notes

- Kill all corporate jargon ("discovery friction", "AI-powered", "conversion")
- Use italics for book titles and emphasis
- Mockups need realistic page context, not isolated components
- One sentence per position, no bullet points
- Voice should feel like a friend showing you something cool
